# KubeFit

[한국어](README.md) | **English**

KubeFit is a GitOps-first Kubernetes resource optimization platform. It analyzes
real workload metrics, explains its recommendations, and proposes reviewed YAML
changes through GitHub pull requests instead of mutating production workloads.

> Measure first. Explain the trade-off. Change through GitOps.

![KubeFit live counterbalanced pair review](docs/assets/pair-review-live.png)

The stored pair on the right was fully replayed from two opposite-order live benchmark
artifacts before the dashboard displayed `PASS`. The editable scenario panel on the
left is example input and is not the source of that verdict.

## MVP scope

- Analyze Kubernetes `Deployment` resources
- Read CPU and memory usage from Prometheus
- Recommend requests and limits from CPU P95 and memory P99
- Compare estimated cost and operational risk
- Generate a Kubernetes YAML patch
- Open a GitHub draft pull request
- Compare before/after behavior with load tests

HPA recommendations, multi-cloud support, predictive incident detection,
Terraform generation, and an AI chatbot are intentionally outside the first
release.

## Verified MVP evidence

KubeFit's MVP is complete on `main`. The current submission evidence is deliberately
split by claim so a cost projection, one passing run, and a repeated experiment cannot
be mistaken for one another:

| Claim | Reproducible evidence |
|---|---|
| Resource recommendations, package boundaries, and the demo contract are safety-gated | 403 Python tests on the current source |
| The review UI builds and behaves as specified | 19 dashboard tests and a production Vite build |
| The package renders with least-privilege defaults | Helm lint and default-template validation |
| The production image actually starts | Docker startup, numeric non-root user, health, dashboard, and disabled-storage smoke checks |
| Controlled observation works on Kubernetes | 100,501 requests, 0 errors, and 100% usage/throttling coverage in [record 0060](docs/devlog/0060-validation-informed-cpu-floor.md) |
| Unsafe-looking savings cannot override latency | The 10m candidate and one repeated 20m block were rejected by the fixed steady-P99 gate |
| One counterbalanced pair passed complete replay | [Pair and refinement evidence](docs/devlog/0060-validation-informed-cpu-floor.md) |
| A verified pair becomes a reviewable Git change | Idempotent resource [Draft PR #23](https://github.com/sangmu1126/kubefit/pull/23) and [publication record 0061](docs/devlog/0061-live-pair-draft-publication.md) |
| Repeated evidence is not overstated | The preregistered campaign remains explicitly `incomplete`; no aggregate or significance claim is made |
| Public packages are installable without repository credentials | [v0.3.2 release](https://github.com/sangmu1126/kubefit/releases/tag/v0.3.2) with an anonymously verified image and chart |

The latest live resource PR passed Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 plus Dashboard, Helm,
and Docker in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sangmu1126/kubefit/actions/runs/32749825481).
It proposes CPU `1000m/2000m → 20m/40m` and memory `2Gi/4Gi → 32Mi/48Mi`, with an
illustrative request-cost projection of `73.000000 → 1.396125` USD per month. This is
not a measured AWS invoice saving. PR #23 remains Draft and KubeFit did not merge or
deploy it.

The [v0.1.0 release-readiness record](docs/release-readiness.md) preserves the earlier
MVP source boundary. Records [0060](docs/devlog/0060-validation-informed-cpu-floor.md),

release, package-content audit, replayable public evidence, presentation boundary,
operator-triggered demonstration, visual decision path, verified public patch release,
open-source contribution surface, and submission-evidence audit.

## Repository layout

```text
collector/       Kubernetes and Prometheus adapters
recommender/     Resource recommendation domain logic
evaluator/       Cost, stability, and performance evaluation
gitops/          YAML patch and GitHub pull request integration

benchmarks/      Load tests and reproducible comparisons
docs/            Architecture, security, and evaluation records
tests/           Unit and integration tests
```

The API now has a multi-stage non-root `Dockerfile` and a Helm chart at
[`deploy/helm/kubefit`](deploy/helm/kubefit). The chart defaults to a tokenless
ServiceAccount, read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, health probes, and
explicit resources. Optional observation access creates only namespace-scoped
read-only Roles for explicitly named targets; see the
[chart guide](deploy/helm/kubefit/README.md).

`deploy/local/verify-kubefit-chart.sh` performs the complete disposable-kind proof:
local image build/load, tokenless install, health and packaged-dashboard probes,
scoped RBAC allow/deny matrix, and restoration to tokenless defaults. It refuses
non-kind targets and does not push an image or delete the cluster.

The ordered delivery phases and their completion criteria are documented in
[`docs/implementation-plan.md`](docs/implementation-plan.md).

To run KubeFit against a disposable kind cluster with Prometheus, follow the
[`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md) guide.

Engineering decisions, failed assumptions, diagrams, and reproducible evidence are
recorded in the [`docs/devlog/`](docs/devlog/README.md) development journal.

The local dashboard sends editable example evidence to the existing evaluation API
or loads the JSON emitted by `kubefit analyze`. New schema v2 artifacts retain
aggregate observation and recommendation-policy inputs, so the API replays the
recommendation, risk, cost comparison, and patch eligibility before returning the
review model. The UI contains no independent recommendation logic. Schema v1
remains compatible and is labeled `integrity_only`; schema v2 is labeled
`recommendation_replayed`. Neither version retains raw Prometheus time series for
percentile aggregation replay. Run it with the API using the commands in the
[local development guide](docs/local-development.md). The multi-stage Docker build
packages its immutable production bundle into the same non-root API image used by
Helm.

Repository CI separates Python, dashboard, Helm, and Docker failures. The Python gate
runs the same hash-locked install, compatibility check, lint, and test sequence on
Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 without fail-fast cancellation. The Docker gate does not
stop at image construction: it starts the packaged image on an ephemeral loopback
port, verifies the numeric non-root user, health endpoint, dashboard HTML, and
disabled-by-default benchmark storage, then removes the exact temporary container.

The separate `Release packages` workflow accepts only an existing annotated semantic
version tag that matches the Python and Helm versions. It publishes an amd64/arm64
GHCR image and OCI Helm chart, then uses a fresh job without package permission to
verify the image digest, anonymous pull/runtime, and anonymous chart pull. The
workflow is a release mechanism, not current publication evidence; use a version only
after that version's final anonymous verification job has passed.

Benchmark results can be reviewed either by selecting a local result directory or
through `/?benchmark=benchmark-<digest>`. Counterbalanced pairs use
`/?pair=benchmark-pair-<digest>`, and completed repeated campaigns use
`/?campaign=benchmark-campaign-evidence-<digest>`. Shareable queries are enabled only
when the API has the corresponding explicit read-only results, pairs, or
`KUBEFIT_BENCHMARK_CAMPAIGN_EVIDENCE_DIRECTORY` root. The server revalidates the
complete evidence before returning a review. Pair review plots both order-specific
changes and their observed minimum–maximum range. Campaign review plots chronological
block position and duration plus planned/observed starting order. Neither view calls
its observations a confidence interval or aggregate effect. KubeFit does not publish
artifacts or make a local directory public automatically.

After building `kubefit:dev`, `deploy/local/generate-image-sbom.sh` resolves the
mutable tag to its complete local image ID and publishes a verified SPDX 2.3
inventory under the ignored `.kubefit/supply-chain/` directory. Repeated runs
rehash and reuse the existing artifact. This is package inventory evidence, not a
vulnerability scan or signature.

The same verifier can inspect a published release without treating a hand-written
dependency summary as a complete SBOM:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sangmu1126/kubefit:0.3.2
KUBEFIT_IMAGE_REFERENCE=ghcr.io/sangmu1126/kubefit:0.3.2 \
  ./deploy/local/generate-image-sbom.sh
```

Release images also carry the BuildKit SBOM and provenance attestations emitted by
the package workflow. These attestations and the local SPDX inventory do not imply
that the image is vulnerability-free or cryptographically signed by the maintainer.
Because the dashboard is compiled into static assets, its bundled JavaScript
dependencies are tracked by `dashboard/package-lock.json` and may not appear as
separate packages in a scanner's final-image SPDX output.

## Quick start

### Replay the verified pair

With Docker running, one command downloads the public self-contained evidence,
verifies its pinned SHA-256, mounts it read-only, and starts the published image:

```bash
./deploy/local/run-verified-pair-demo.sh
```

Open the printed `http://127.0.0.1:8000/?showcase=decision-journey` URL. Press
**추천 계산 실행**, then follow the Decision Console's **20m Pair 검증 계속** action.
The published `v0.3.2` image visualizes current, observed, rejected, and verified
resources plus the source-labeled execution trace, opposite orders, and policy checks.
The exact YAML diff and Draft PR link open only after `PASS`. The script binds only to
loopback, never contacts Kubernetes, and removes its container on Ctrl+C. Set
`KUBEFIT_DEMO_PORT` if port 8000 is already in use.

To test uncommitted current-source changes instead of the published `v0.3.2` image,
build and run with the same script:

```bash
KUBEFIT_DEMO_BUILD_LOCAL=true ./deploy/local/run-verified-pair-demo.sh
```

This route connects a live recommendation calculation to the recorded
`reject → refine → verify → Draft PR` narrative and the same server-replayed Pair.
The UI labels live API responses separately from committed evidence. The published
`v0.3.2` image and current-source path use the same APIs, Decision Console, and
digest-pinned `v0.2.0` Pair evidence; only the application image source differs.

### Open only the editable review scenario

The published image contains both FastAPI and the React review dashboard. No local
Node.js or Kubernetes cluster is required for the editable review scenario:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  ghcr.io/sangmu1126/kubefit:0.3.2
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. This default screen evaluates editable example inputs
through the API and does not collect from or mutate a cluster. A fully replayed stored
benchmark or pair additionally requires its read-only evidence directory; follow the
[local dashboard guide](docs/local-development.md#open-a-fully-verified-benchmark-pair-or-campaign-link).

### Install the development environment

Requires Python 3.12+.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements/build.lock
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements/dev.lock
python -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
python -m pip check
pytest -q
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

Maintainers regenerate all three Python locks with `pip-tools==7.6.1` and
`deploy/local/compile-python-locks.sh`; normal installs consume the reviewed locks
rather than resolving compatible ranges again.

Then open `http://localhost:8000/docs`. Use `POST /v1/recommendations` for the
capacity result alone or `POST /v1/evaluations` for a recommendation plus an
explicit request-cost comparison.

Analyze a live Deployment (with Prometheus reachable locally):

```bash
kubefit readiness --context kind-kubefit \
  --namespace kubefit-demo --deployment overprovisioned-api \
  --prometheus-url http://localhost:9090 \
  --identity-store .kubefit/identities.json --days 1

kubefit analyze --namespace kubefit-demo --deployment overprovisioned-api \
  --prometheus-url http://localhost:9090 \
  --identity-store .kubefit/identities.json \
  --cpu-core-hour-usd 0.04 \
  --memory-gib-hour-usd 0.005 \
  --price-source example://local-model
```

The CLI invokes `kubectl` using the current context, reads only Deployment and
Pod metadata, queries Prometheus, and prints a recommendation with its evidence.
Prometheus must scrape cAdvisor metrics plus `kube_pod_owner` from
kube-state-metrics. KubeFit filters ReplicaSets through their Kubernetes controller
owner UID and clips history to the current Deployment creation time, avoiding
Pod-name prefixes and same-name workload history.

For the local competition demo, do not wait on a one-day mostly idle window. Run the
fixed one-hour `benchmarks/k6/observation_profile.js` traffic profile and use
`--observation-profile demo` for both readiness and analysis. This path requires 90%
coverage and labels its result controlled-demo-only. The default `production`
profile remains multi-day and is intended for representative real traffic.

If a benchmark rejects an aggressive CPU floor, `kubefit reanalyze` can derive a
stricter schema v2 analysis from the retained observation and pricing inputs without
pretending that new metrics were collected. The command can only raise the retained
floor; the override remains explicit in the replayable recommendation policy.

`kubefit readiness` uses the same collection and policy path without requiring
price inputs. It distinguishes evidence that only needs more collection time from
unstable replicas, missing Pod signals, and already observed high-risk conditions.
Time estimates state their stable-replica and continued-scrape assumptions.

The evaluator also reads the cAdvisor CPU throttled-period counters and current
Kubernetes target-container status. Missing throttling metrics or incomplete Pod
status coverage keeps the relevant risk `unknown`; an observed OOMKilled state is
reported as high risk even when the wider observation window is incomplete.

Every evaluation includes `patch_eligibility`. Future GitOps patch generation must
require `eligible`; insufficient readiness and high or unknown safety risks produce
stable machine-readable blocking checks. Medium risk remains an explicit reviewer
warning and never becomes an invisible pass.

The `gitops` package can generate a stale-safe manifest proposal from an eligible
evaluation. It matches one `apps/v1` Deployment and container across supplied YAML
sources, verifies that repository resources still equal the evaluated workload, and
returns patched content, a unified diff, and a SHA-256-backed report without writing
the file. Only the changed resource scalar ranges are replaced, preserving unrelated
documents, fields, comments, order, and quoting.

An eligible patch can be published as an immutable proposal bundle containing the
before/after manifests, canonical evaluation, diff, report, and benchmark context.
Its ID is derived from content, every payload is indexed by SHA-256 and byte size,
and publication uses a private staging directory followed by one directory rename.
Identical retries reuse the bundle; modified or partial existing content is rejected.

The `benchmarks` package defines `kubefit-load-v1`, a fixed k6 warmup → steady →
spike → recovery profile, plus typed before/after measurements and an explicit
safety verdict. Results must reference the same proposal, profile, and complete
offered load before latency, errors, throttling, OOM, and recovery regressions are
evaluated. Per-phase completed iterations must meet the fixed minimum and match
the minimum or its single scheduler-boundary overshoot in each run. Missing work or
two extra iterations remains invalid. Request-cost change is reported separately and
cannot override safety.

The benchmark execution core revalidates every proposal hash before cluster access,
requires an explicit kubectl context, executes a selected `before-after` or
`after-before` sequence, and reapplies the before manifest on every exit path after
mutation starts. Measurement timestamps must prove non-overlapping intervals and
every single sequential result carries an order-bias warning. The CLI is
restricted to an explicitly acknowledged disposable `kind-*` cluster and is not a
production automation interface. After Kubernetes reports rollout completion, the
runner also waits until exactly the desired number of selected Pods remain and every
target container is Running and Ready, preventing terminating rollout Pods from
contaminating the runtime snapshot.

The aligned measurement collector brackets the fixed k6 run with Pod-level runtime
snapshots, queries Prometheus throttling inside that run, derives recovery from raw
timestamped samples, and selects the proposal-fixed monthly request cost. Its output
records run timestamps, Pod identity, and raw/summary hashes. The result publisher
retains those inputs in a separate immutable benchmark artifact.

Completed benchmark executions can now be published separately from their proposal
as immutable `benchmark-<digest>` artifacts. Each result binds canonical before/after
measurements, exact k6 summaries and raw streams, the recomputed verdict, and a
human-readable report with per-file hashes. Identical publication retries reuse the
same result; tampered or partial existing content is never overwritten.

`kubefit benchmark` composes the local workflow under a Deployment-scoped OS lock.
It requires an explicit `kind-*` context and `--confirm-disposable-cluster`, holds
the lock through restoration and result publication, then prints a compact JSON
handoff. A rollout-safe local Service proxy, a Prometheus port-forward, and an
existing immutable proposal are currently required; see
[`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md).

Operators can counterbalance time-order effects by running the same proposal once in
each order. `kubefit benchmark-pair` fully verifies both content-addressed artifacts
and emits one deterministic PASS/FAIL/INVALID policy-agreement assessment. A passing
assessment is published with complete copies of both benchmark bundles as an immutable
`benchmark-pair-<digest>` artifact. It does not average two samples or claim statistical
significance; this self-contained pair is a mandatory publication input.
The same verified pair supplies an order-aware metric table in the Draft PR and a
read-only dashboard plot. It reports whether both changes improved, regressed, stayed
equal, or pointed in different directions, without averaging the two trials.

Repeated evidence can be preregistered with `kubefit benchmark-campaign-plan`. The
immutable plan fixes an explicit pair count, balances and randomizes which execution
order starts each time block, and requires every planned block before completion.
`kubefit benchmark-campaign-check` fully reloads supplied pair artifacts and rejects
duplicates, proposal/profile/cost drift, overlapping time blocks, schedule violations,
and outcome-dependent early stopping. COMPLETE publishes an immutable, self-contained
`benchmark-campaign-evidence-<digest>` with the plan and every pair bundle, then reloads
it before returning success. Campaign completion is optional advanced evidence: it does
not yet compute variance or replace the mandatory single-pair publication gate.

`kubefit analyze` emits a typed schema v2 artifact binding aggregate observation,
policy, and evaluation evidence to Deployment UID and creation time. Loading it
replays the saved recommendation decision. `kubefit propose` consumes that identity
directly with repository-bounded YAML sources and publishes an immutable proposal;
it does not allow the target to be retyped. Benchmark preflight rejects a recreated
Deployment before any apply. Multi-document source files remain byte-exact review
evidence, while benchmark apply and restoration use separately hashed,
single-Deployment manifests so neighboring Services or workloads are never
reconciled.

After a passing benchmark pair, `build_pull_request_plan` independently reloads the
proposal, primary before-after benchmark, and self-contained pair artifact. It replays
both embedded benchmark results and their pair assessment, requires the primary result
to be a member of that pair, and produces a deterministic one-file draft PR contract.
The contract includes the exact expected repository source hash, patched content,
benchmark metrics, pair identity, both order-specific changes and their observed
range, cost caveats, warnings, and rollback guidance. Supplying
`--benchmark-campaign-evidence` explicitly also reloads the complete repeated campaign,
requires the mandatory pair to be one of its chronological blocks, and adds the
campaign IDs and block table to the same PR body. Omitting it preserves the normal
pair-only publication path. This stage is read-only; branch creation and GitHub
publication remain separate adapters.

`commit_pull_request_plan` applies that contract to an explicit clean Git top-level.
It rechecks the source hash and bytes, rejects symlinks and detached HEAD, creates a
one-file commit on the deterministic branch, verifies the resulting Git tree, and
returns to the original branch. An identical existing branch is reused; a collision
fails closed. It does not push or contact GitHub.

`publish_pull_request` revalidates that local handoff, derives the GitHub repository
identity from a credential-free `github.com` remote, and publishes the exact commit
with an absent-ref lease. It reuses only an identical remote ref and an exact open
draft PR contract; conflicting refs, duplicate matches, and edited PRs fail closed.
Ambiguous push or API responses are resolved by observing remote state again. The
GitHub token is sent only as an HTTP authorization header. This library boundary is
exposed by `kubefit publish`, which requires `--confirm-publish` and reads the token
only from a named environment variable. The command never merges or deploys the
change.

`kubefit publish-check` runs the same artifact and local Git validation without
creating a commit, then reads the configured GitHub remote ref and, when a token is
present, repository metadata through a GET request. Its JSON separates blockers
from warnings and always reports `mutation_performed: false`. A `ready` result means
the observable preconditions passed; it does not prove effective branch or pull
request write permission.

The authenticated two-run verification procedure is documented in
[`docs/live-github-demo.md`](docs/live-github-demo.md). It requires a separately named
private disposable repository, captures first-create and second-reuse evidence, and
archives rather than deletes the target by default.

`kubefit verify-publication` then validates the runbook's exact five-file evidence
set without network access. It rebuilds the proposal/benchmark/pair plan, checks the
preflight, two publication outputs, remote ref, and GitHub Draft PR as one contract,
hashes every file, and emits a deterministic `publication-<digest>` verification ID.
When optional campaign evidence is supplied, it additionally binds the campaign IDs
and requires the independently captured GitHub body to equal the generated body.

The example prices are illustrative, not a cloud-provider price claim. Live
analysis requires the caller to provide CPU and memory rates plus a source label.
The output repeats those assumptions and separates current/recommended CPU and
memory request costs. Projected request savings do not necessarily become invoice
savings because node fragmentation, discounts, taxes, and autoscaling replica-hours
are outside this model.

The optional identity store retains observed ReplicaSet names after Kubernetes
deletes their objects. It is an atomic local JSON snapshot containing identifiers
only; a new Deployment UID replaces same-name history rather than merging it.

Example request:

```json
{
  "current": {
    "cpu_request_millicores": 1000,
    "cpu_limit_millicores": 2000,
    "memory_request_mib": 2048,
    "memory_limit_mib": 4096
  },
  "observed": {
    "cpu_p95_millicores": 230,
    "memory_p99_mib": 710,
    "cpu_max_millicores": 400,
    "memory_max_mib": 900,
    "sample_count": 1900,
    "observation_coverage": 0.95,
    "desired_replicas": 2,
    "available_replicas": 2,
    "observed_replicas": 2
  }
}
```

For `/v1/evaluations`, add the following top-level fields to the same request:

```json
{
  "cost_assumptions": {
    "cpu_core_hour_usd": "0.04",
    "memory_gib_hour_usd": "0.005",
    "monthly_hours": "730",
    "price_source": "example://local-model"
  },
  "replica_count": 2
}
```

When maxima or sufficient observation coverage are unavailable, KubeFit reports
the related risk as `unknown` rather than presenting an unsupported low-risk claim.
The recommendation is actionable only when its `readiness.status` is `ready`.

## Project origin

KubeFit grew from lessons about over-allocation and observability learned while
operating an earlier serverless platform. It is independently designed and
implemented as an open-source Kubernetes optimization tool. The prior project
is context, not this repository's codebase or deployment architecture.
